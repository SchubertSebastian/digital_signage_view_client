= Webclient frontend

== Docker

=== Build

To build the frontend use the following command:

[source,bash]
....
docker build -t dispway/webclient-web .
....

=== Usage

This image starts a webserver on the port 80 and responds only to the environment variable `API_HOST` (The trailing `/api` is essential). The `API_HOST` tells the SPA where to make the requests and should be define when the container is starting and not afterwards. If `API_HOST` is not defined the webserver uses the default value in the `environment.prod.ts` file:

[source,bash]
....
docker run -p 80:80 -e API_HOST=https://example.museum.com/api dispway/webclient-web
....
